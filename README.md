# VirtualReadvertising

Virtual Readvertising is a PC application designed to mix the viewing capabilities of 360 degree photos and videos. The idea is to merge 360 degree photos and videos into a bitmap of points of interest, being able to click on a point in a building and seeing a virtual tour of that space whether it is an office, museum, or other attraction. Virtual Readvertising is a potential application to advertise companies with 360 degree video tours and 360 degree photo interest spots to appeal to a growing virtual reality market.
